# Project_Cyberpunk
Project Cyberpunk is my Bachelor Thesis made in Unity 5. This game will allow you to handle a team of characters where you can swap them anytime you want to use them as your active character. The game consists of 2 levels. First level is a checkpoint based run where players have to cross an area and face groups of enemies. Second level is an elimination count based level. Player has to eliminate a certain number of enemies before making his exit. This is the playable prototype.
